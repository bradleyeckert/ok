# Terminals

`ok` is a console app. You run it from a terminal.

## ConEmu

[ConEmu](https://conemu.github.io/) is a terminal for Windows. It is better than the stock Windows console.

`ok` inputs and outputs byte streams, so ConEmu should be set up for UTF-8. Add `chcp 65001` to the startup environment settings within ConEmu.
