# H753 sample implementation

The STM32CubeIDE (Eclipse) project in the H753 folder runs on a [NUCLEO-H753ZI](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-h753zi.html).

## compiling

Install the STM32Cube tools (MX, IDE, and Prog) on your PC. MX and IDE will want a decent computer.
Import the project into the IDE's workspace and Build it.
Turn on the "binary output" option of you like to program by DFU drag-and-drop.

## running

Once it is running, you can use `ok` to connect to it. In ok's console,

`com-list` lists the serial ports in the system  
`port!` word sets the port.  
`remote` tries to connect to `targ` using the current port.  
`local` connects to ok's internal VM and closes the serial port.

## How'd we do?

`mips` measures the speed of the VM.

Even on a $140 GMKtec NucBox G5 Mini PC (If you have the means, I highly recommend picking one up),
the VM runs at 65 MIPs.

On the STM32H753 with a 400 MHz system clock, I get a MIPS reading of 1.14 MIPs.
I did not turn on caching, which means this number could be greatly improved without much effort.

The binary image programmed into the NUCLEO-H753ZI is about 27KB.
That includes initialization code generated by MX, the BCI (thin client),
serial port encryption and authentication, and the VM.
